# Graphics engine

# How to Play:
- W moves you forward
- S moves you backwards
- A and D roatate you left and right
- The arrow keys move you up and down, left and right

# Objective:
- Kill as many asteroids as you can to get the highest score! (or just edit the highscore file :P)
- If you run out of ammo pick up an ammo box (the cubes that spawn around you)

# Notes:
-if you resize the window the game breaks sooooo...
