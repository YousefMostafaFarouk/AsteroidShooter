# Graphics engine

# How to Play:
- W moves you forward.
- S moves you backwards.
- A and D roatate you left and right.
- The arrow keys move you up and down, left and right.

# Objective:
- Kill as many asteroids as you can to get the highest score! (or just edit the highscore file :P).
- If you run out of ammo pick up an ammo box (the cubes that spawn around you).

# Notes:
- If you resize the window the game breaks sooooo...
- If you just want to try out the game then download the release file!
# How to run:
- If you are using VisualStudio then simply open the solution file and run it.
- If you are building this on VSCode make sure to include the -lwinmm flag when compiling example: (g++ -o output.exe AsteroidShooter.cpp -lwinmm).
- If you are running this on VSCode then also make sure to not open the EXE file in the integrated terminal of VSCode since this is a command console application that causes problems instead navigate to the EXE file and double click on it.
